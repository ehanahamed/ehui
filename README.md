TODO NOW:
 - mobile header
    - add `position: static` to `header` as an option to "hide header"
      - no, it doesn't effect its width
      - make that option `static` default on mobile
      - make `sticky` default on desktop
      - the setting thingy will be under `options` which will toggle between letting the header scroll with the page or stay at the top
 - javascript-localstorage-save options (like disableanimations & the new hideornohidetheheader)
    - just like with the theme-save-and-load localstorage thingy
 - document usage of `i`/italic vs `b`/bold in writing
 - `<a>` has its own size, breaks `.h1`, `.h2`, etc
 - `<code>` has its own size, breaks `.h1`, `.h2`, etc
 - `layouts.css`
    - `thingwrapthing` that uses `alignthing` should be `thingalignthing`
    - `thingthing` that uses `justifything` should be `thingjustifything`
    - correct justify and align use in class names
 - fix margin(s)
    - temporary fix for `p`, labelled `/* TEMPORARY FIX */` in `components.css`
 - autocomplete/autofill colors
 - make sure tab works on file inputs
 - MAKE SURE EVERY REPO & SITE HAS DESIGNSYS RENAMED!
 - styleguide
    - & specifically **camelCase**
    - consistant image alt tag (+ and in quizfreely)
       - currently most are `<img ... alt="image" ...`
    - fix incorrect `<br/>`, and encorage correct `<br/>` use in examples & actual html

TODO EXTRA:
 - fancy betterthantab keyboard shortcut system
